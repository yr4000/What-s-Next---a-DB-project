Main Flow:

INPUT:
user chooses a location on the map + distance + specific category
OUTPUT:
1. data pane displays a list of places from that category
2. markers appear on the map for each place
3. display top places that are NOT from within the search list results
4. [bonus] a slider/input field that allows the user to conveniently change radius and search again

----- (A2): Alternative for A1 -----
INPUT:

OUTPUT:
1. data pane displays a list of places fitting that name


----- (B) -----

2. data pane displays details of X: name, rating, address, reviews

4. [bonus] markers appear on the map for each place near X, in different colors for each category


----- (C) -----

2. data pane displays amount of places (including reviews)
3. display top places that are NOT from within the search list results


----- (D): Bonus -----

NOTES:
1. The flow should be A->B->C->A->...->D (D can only be reached once, and is the final stage)
2. We HAVE to make sure that are a lot of "picks" before we delivery date.
3. Zoom of map should always fit to display all places
4. User should be able to choose in each category whether to start from (A1) or (A2)
